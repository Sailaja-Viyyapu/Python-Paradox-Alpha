1. Distinguish between variable, constant and literals with example.

ANSWER:
--------
variable :- It is a name of location in memory that enables us to store a value for later use. 
            It is called a variable because you can change the content in it whenever you want.
example :- i=10 // here 'i' is a variable
           i="python world"

constant :- It is also like a variable.
            But the only difference is that, it cannot be changed once defined.
 example :- const i=10 // here 'i' is a constant, it value cannot be changed throughout the execution of the programme.
 
 literal :- Literals are values assigned to variables and constants.
 example :- i=10 // here 10 is literal.


2.Define identifiers and datatypes.

ANSWER:
---------
identifiers :-An identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object. 
              An identifier starts with a letter "A to Z" or "a to z" or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters, underscores and digits (0 to 9).
example :- name ="sailaja viyyapu".

datatypes :-Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. 
           Data types represent a kind of value which determines what operations can be performed on that data. 
           Numeric, non-numeric and Boolean (true/false) data are the most used data types.
 Examples :-Integer, float, boolean,list,tuple... etc

3.Write a program to declare two variable, take one of them from user and determine one by self then compare and print them.

CODE:
-----
    
    var1=input("Enter a value:")
    print(var1)
    var2=20
    print(var1==var2)
