5)----------standard data types-------

Data types are the classification or categorization of data items.
Data types represent a kind of value which determines what operations can be performed on that data
1.	Integer : we use it for number postive or negative but without decimal point 
        int a=10 or int a=-10
2.	Character : we use it for only single alphabet
        char c='s'
3.	String : we use it for name and any collect of alphabet
        Str s="fruits"
4.	Float : we use it for number in decimal
        Float f=10.333
5.	Complex : A number with a real and imaginary component represented as x+yj. 
                x and y are floats and j is -1(square root of -1 called an imaginary number)
        Complex cp=5i+4j
6.	Double #we use it for number and char Inc. the size 
7.	Long #we use it for number and char also it creates whole block and also Inc. the size
8.	Short #we use it for number
9.	Unsigned #we use it for number
10.	Signed, etc #we use it for number
